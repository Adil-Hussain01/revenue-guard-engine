# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is generally handled by the consumer. In a CLI, service, or other application, they
#   could be useful to include in source control, so you can uncomment them as needed.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in cases where the author of a package wants to distribute it across several
#   versions of Python, the lock file should be ignored.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
