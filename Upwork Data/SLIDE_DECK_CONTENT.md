## 📅 Slide 1: Introduction

**Headline:** Revenue Guard: The Automated Auditor

**Visual:** 
*   A clean, minimal title card.
*   **Key Stat:** "5% of Revenue is Leaked Due to System Errors (Gartner)"

**Content:**
*   Revenue Leakage is the silent gap between Sales (CRM) and Finance (Accounting).
*   **Problem:** Manual audits are slow, error-prone, and expensive.
*   **Solution:** An intelligent engine to validate every transaction automatically.

## 🚧 Slide 2: The Core Problem

**Headline:** Where Does the Money Go?

**Visual:**
*   A simplified "Leakage Flow" diagram.
*   **Left:** CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot) showing 100 Deals ($10k).
*   **Right:** Accounting (QuickBooks/Xero) showing 95 Invoices ($9.5k).
*   **Middle:** A "Leakage Gap" ($500 Lost).

**Content:**
*   **Discrepancies:** "Deal Won" in CRM vs. "Draft Invoice" in Finance.
*   **Pricing Drift:** Unauthorized discounts given by Sales Reps.
*   **Missing Payments:** Cash collected but not recorded against the order.

## ⚙️ Slide 3: The Technical Solution (Architecture)

**Headline:** How It Works: The Validation Engine

**Visual:**
*   System Architecture Diagram (Simulation -> API Simulators -> Validation Engine -> Reporting).

**Content:**
*   **Step 1: Data Ingestion:** Real-time sync from CRM & Finance APIs.
*   **Step 2: Simulation:** Synthetic data generator for robust testing (10k+ scenarios).
*   **Step 3: Validation Logic:** 12+ rigorous rules (Tax Check, Price Match, Status Sync).
*   **Step 4: Risk Scoring:** Weighted algorithm to prioritize `CRITICAL` issues.

## 📈 Slide 4: Real-Time Insights

**Headline:** Actionable Intelligence

**Visual:**
*   Screenshots of the Matplotlib Dashboards generated by the engine.
*   **Chart 1:** "Detected Leakage by Category" (Price Mismatch vs. Missing Invoice).
*   **Chart 2:** "Risk Heatmap" (High vs. Low Priority Violations).

**Content:**
*   **Immediate Visibility:** Managers see leakage trends instantly.
*   **Drill-Down:** Click into specific transactions to see the audit trail.
*   **Audit Trail:** JSON-based logs for compliance and tracing.

## 🚀 Slide 5: Business Impact

**Headline:** Recover Revenue, Reduce Risk

**Visual:**
*   Before/After Comparison.
*   **Before:** Manual Excel Sheets (Days to complete).
*   **After:** Automated Dashboard (Seconds to complete).

**Content:**
*   **Speed:** 99% reduction in audit time.
*   **Accuracy:** 100% detection of predefined anomalies.
*   **ROI:** Identify missed revenue > Cost of the software.
