# 🚀 MASTER PROJECT PROMPT

## Revenue Leakage Detection & Validation Engine

## CRM → Finance Intelligent Reconciliation System

---

## SYSTEM ROLE

You are a **Senior Enterprise Automation Architect**.

Your task is to build a **portfolio-grade Upwork demonstration project**.

The project must simulate a real client business problem.

Focus on:

* Client pain point demonstration
* Practical workflow automation
* Audit-grade validation
* Visualization
* API playground interaction

---

# 🎯 CLIENT-ORIENTED PROJECT GOAL

Build a system that helps companies detect revenue leakage across:

```
GoHighLevel CRM → Validation Intelligence Layer → QuickBooks Accounting System
```

---

# 🧠 BUSINESS PROBLEM SIMULATION

Many companies lose revenue because of:

* Pricing mismatches
* Manual approval drift
* Invoice generation errors
* Discount abuse
* Data synchronization failures

Your system must demonstrate detection + prevention.

---

# 🏗 ENTERPRISE-STYLE ARCHITECTURE

Use **API-first design simulation**.

---

## CRM Layer — GoHighLevel Simulation

Implement mock API structure matching GoHighLevel style endpoints.

Required Entities:

* Contacts
* Deals
* Opportunities
* Order Metadata

Simulate:

* Order creation
* Discount assignment
* Approval status

---

## Finance Layer — QuickBooks Simulation

Implement mock QuickBooks-style accounting API.

Entities:

* Invoice
* Payment
* Ledger Entry
* Account Balance

Simulate:

* Invoice posting
* Payment reconciliation
* Status drift detection

---

## Intelligence Validation Layer (Core Differentiator)

Create deterministic business logic engine.

Must validate:

### Pricing Integrity

* Discount threshold enforcement
* Margin protection

Default Rule:

```
Allowed Discount ≤ 15%
```

---

### Order → Invoice Consistency

Check:

* Order ID mapping
* Amount matching
* Payment completion status

---

### Leakage Risk Scoring

Generate risk score:

```
Risk Score = Weighted Rule Violation Sum
```

Range:

| Score  | Meaning  |
| ------ | -------- |
| 0–30   | Safe     |
| 30–70  | Monitor  |
| 70–100 | Critical |

---

# 📊 DATA SIMULATION REQUIREMENT

Generate synthetic enterprise dataset.

Minimum:

* 1000 transactions
* Include anomalies

Inject realistic business noise:

* Missing invoice records
* Pricing drift
* Duplicate billing
* Unauthorized discount simulation

---

# 🌐 OPENAPI PLAYGROUND (MANDATORY)

Build interactive testing interface.

Must allow user to:

✅ Create CRM Order
✅ Generate Invoice
✅ Run Validation Engine
✅ View Risk Score
✅ Inspect Audit Log

Use:

* FastAPI or equivalent backend framework

Provide Swagger/OpenAPI visualization.

---

# 📈 VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

Use matplotlib.

Strict rules:

* One chart per plot
* No subplot grid layouts
* No hardcoded colors unless necessary

Generate:

### Chart 1 — Risk Score Distribution

Histogram of transaction risk scores.

---

### Chart 2 — Revenue Leakage Prevention Simulation

Show:

Before Automation → After Engine

Metrics:

* Manual Review Time
* Error Detection Rate
* Audit Visibility Score

---

### Chart 3 — Transaction Validation Result Breakdown

Show:

* Passed Transactions
* Warning Transactions
* Failed Transactions

---

# 🔐 AUDIT LOGGER SYSTEM

Must record:

* Transaction ID
* Rule triggered
* Risk score path
* Timestamp
* Decision outcome

Store logs in structured JSON format.

---

# 🧩 CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

* Use Object Oriented Programming
* Include exception handling
* Write modular reusable components
* Provide detailed comments explaining business logic

---

# 🚀 GITHUB DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS

Output must include:

## 1. Installation Guide

## 2. Execution Steps

## 3. Repository Initialization Commands

## 4. Dependency List

## 5. Deployment Notes

---
